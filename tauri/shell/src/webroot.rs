//! Serving the bundled website — the module this shell would be wrong to
//! simplify.
//!
//! The site is served from a registered private scheme (`game://`, see
//! [`crate::config`]) handled in-process: no port to pick, no port to collide
//! with, no socket listening on the player's machine, and no window in which
//! another program could talk to it. Three properties matter and each is easy
//! to lose:
//!
//!  1. **One stable origin.** The player's settings live in `localStorage`,
//!     which is keyed by origin. `game://` is a constant, so they survive every
//!     update. A `file://` page (or a server on an ephemeral port) would hand
//!     the player a different origin — and a game that had forgotten
//!     everything — at some point.
//!
//!  2. **Correct Content-Type, from us.** The site is ES modules; a browser
//!     refuses a module served as anything but a JavaScript type, and the
//!     failure is a blank screen rather than an error. So the type is mapped
//!     explicitly from the extension here rather than left to be inferred.
//!
//!  3. **No path escape.** The URL path is attacker-influenced in principle
//!     (any link the page follows), so the resolved file is checked to be
//!     INSIDE the webroot before it is read.
//!
//! **Property 3 is done twice here, and on purpose.** The path is first
//! normalized LEXICALLY — segments resolved, `..` refused outright — and the
//! joined result is then checked to still start with the root. Either half
//! alone has a known hole (a lexical pass alone is defeated by a symlink inside
//! the webroot; a prefix check alone is defeated by a `..` that the filesystem
//! resolves before the comparison).
