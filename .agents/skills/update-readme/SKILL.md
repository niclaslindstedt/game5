# Updating the README

**Governing spec sections:** §3 (`README.md` — required sections and content), §21.5 (this skill is mandated because `README.md` is a drift-prone artifact).

`README.md` is the primary user-facing documentation for Fall Line. Per §3 of `OSS_GAME_SPEC.md` it must keep its twelve sections (What / Why / Prerequisites / Install / Quick start / Usage / Configuration / Examples / Troubleshooting / Documentation / Contributing / License) accurate. It goes stale whenever a command, the skis, a control, a URL, or the install story changes without a matching edit.

## Tracking mechanism

`.agents/skills/update-readme/.last-updated` contains the git commit hash from the last successful run. Empty means "never run" — fall back to the initial commit of the repository.

## Discovery process

1. Read the baseline:

   ```sh
   BASELINE=$(cat .agents/skills/update-readme/.last-updated)
   ```

2. List commits since the baseline:

   ```sh
   git log --oneline "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

3. List changed files:

   ```sh
   git diff --name-only "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

4. Categorize the changes using the mapping table below.

5. Read the current `README.md` so you can preserve voice and unrelated sections while editing.

## Mapping table

| Changed files / scope | README section(s) to update |
| --- | --- |
| `package.json` scripts, `Makefile` targets (a lab added or renamed: `sim`, `level`, `analyze`, `ride`, `world`, `audition`, `screenshots`, `profile`, the `tauri*` and `native-*` targets) | **Usage** table — and `AGENTS.md`'s labs table moves with it |
| `engine/game/defs/skis.ts` | **What** (the six pairs and what each is) |
| `pwa/src/game/settings-input.ts`, `input.ts`, `input-model.ts`, `hud.tsx`, `hud-touch.tsx` | **Controls** (the keys, the edge thumb and the tuck lever) |
| `pwa/src/identity.ts`, `pwa/public/CNAME` | Links, badges, **What**, **Usage** (install) |
| `engine/mapgen/rules.ts`, `engine/game/snow.ts` | **What** / **Why** (the generator and the snow claims) |
| `.github/workflows/*` | Badge row |
| `docs/*.md` added/renamed | **Documentation** link list |
| `tauri/`, `native/` (a shell built or changed) | **What** (what exists today), **Why** (web-native), **Usage** |
| `pwa/src/game/url-params.ts` | **Configuration** (the URL parameters) |
| Dependency/auth changes (`.npmrc`, framework) | **Prerequisites**, **Configuration** |
| `LICENSE` | **License** section, badges |

Extend this table every time you find a new source-of-truth file that feeds the README.

## Update checklist

- [ ] Read baseline from `.last-updated` and run `git log` / `git diff --name-only`
- [ ] Read the current `README.md`
- [ ] Walk the mapping table and update each affected section
- [ ] Verify every shell example is still syntactically valid and every link resolves
- [ ] Run `make test` and `make fmt-check`
- [ ] Write the new baseline:

      git rev-parse HEAD > .agents/skills/update-readme/.last-updated

## Verification

1. Re-read every edited section against the corresponding source of truth.
2. Confirm the twelve §3 sections are all present, in order.
3. Confirm `.last-updated` was rewritten with the new `HEAD`.

## Skill self-improvement

After a run, improve this file in place:

1. **Grow the mapping table** with any new source → README relationship you discovered.
2. **Record patterns** for recurring edits.
3. **Commit the skill edit** together with the README edit so the knowledge compounds.
