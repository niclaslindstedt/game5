// each pulse as a duration and a strength, because those are the two things

// no duration to give: iOS offers a fixed vocabulary of taps and nothing
// that runs for 200 ms, so a long pulse has to be spent as a BURST of them.
// Turning one into the other is the whole job of this module.
//
// Pure, like `navigation.ts` beside it, so the root suite can hold the seam
// together without a device: the message the page posts is parsed here and
// asserted against the script that posts it (`tests/rumble_test.ts`).
