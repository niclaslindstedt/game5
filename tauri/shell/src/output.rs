//! The Tauri shell's central output module — the peer of `engine/output.ts`
//! for a tree that runs as a native binary rather than in a browser
//! (OSS_GAME_SPEC §19.4: diagnostics go through one module so they can be
//! silenced, redirected or timestamped in one place, and never scattered as
//! raw `println!` calls).
//!
//! A desktop app has no devtools console a player will ever open, so the
//! shell's stdout IS its diagnostic surface: it is what a bug report pastes.
//! Two rules keep it worth reading —
//!
//!  1. every line is PREFIXED with what emitted it (`webroot:`,
//!     `window-state:`), so a log with three subsystems in it can still be
//!     read; and
//!  2. it stays QUIET by default in a release build, because a shipped game
//!     should not narrate itself. `SH_VERBOSE=1` turns the chatter back on;
//!     warnings and errors are never suppressed, since those are the lines
//!     someone is looking for when they go looking at all.
//!
//! ## THE LAUNCH LOG
//!
//! A packaged game on Windows has no console at all — it is started from an
//! icon, and a line written to stderr goes to a stream nobody is holding. So a
//! shell that fails to start is, from the player's side, a program that does
//! nothing when double-clicked; the whole diagnosis is a file or it does not
//! exist. Every line the shell emits is therefore also appended there, INFO
//! included and regardless of verbosity — a log written only when things go
//! well is the wrong way round.
//!
//! One file per launch (the previous one is kept beside it as `.prev`, which is
//! the copy a player still has after restarting to "see if it does it again"),
//! and written SYNCHRONOUSLY: the lines worth having are the ones emitted
//! immediately before the process dies, and a buffered writer loses exactly
//! those.
