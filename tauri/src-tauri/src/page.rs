//! THE PAGE'S WHOLE VIEW OF THE SHELL.
//!
//! It is one initialization script, evaluated before the game's own scripts on
//! every load, and it exposes exactly two things: a frozen global saying which
//! binary is showing the page (`fallline_shell::config::SHELL_GLOBAL`), and a
//! conversation about the window's fullscreen carried on two DOM events
//! (`SHELL_FULLSCREEN_ASK` / `SHELL_FULLSCREEN_STATE`). The page reads the
//! global in `pwa/src/shell-host.ts` to keep its PWA update lifecycle off in
//! here — the bundle is the update — and holds the other half of the
//! conversation there too.
//!
//! One thing crosses the other way with no script at all: when a macOS menu
//! row is chosen, the shell PRESSES one of the game's own buttons by name
//! ([`press`], on `SHELL_COMMAND`). Told rather than asked, and nothing comes
//! back — a menu bar is a second way to reach buttons the page already has.
//!
//! **The page never sees Tauri.** `withGlobalTauri` is off,
//! `capabilities/default.json` grants the window almost nothing, and the one
//! command it may reach is looked up at CALL time inside `send` rather than
//! captured here — so nothing in this script hands the game a handle it could
//! keep. An ask is a word, the answer is an event, and neither is a handle.
