//! The Tauri desktop shell — as thin as a shell around a finished website can
//! be: one window showing the bundled game, served from a private scheme, plus
//! the one command the page may ask of it (the window's fullscreen).
//!
//! The ORDER of the startup work matters, and two things happen before the
//! window exists:
//!
//!  1. **Is there a display at all** — asked before Tauri's builder, because
//!     the event-loop library unwraps a missing one (`fallline_shell::display`).
//!  2. **The launch log is opened**, so the lines that matter most — the ones
//!     emitted immediately before the process dies — have somewhere to be.
//!
//! Everything security-shaped is deliberate and none of it is default: the
//! renderer is the whole game, so the page gets no Tauri API
//! (`withGlobalTauri` off), an almost-empty permission list
//! (`capabilities/default.json`), one command to reach the shell by, and a
//! window pinned to our own origin (`window::navigation_guard`).
