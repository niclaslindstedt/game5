// EVERYTHING A RUN NEEDS BEFORE ITS FIRST FRAME, paid for in slices.
//
// Standing a map up is the most expensive thing this game does: the
// generator searches its sub-seeds, raises the terrain, lays and grades the
// piste into it, shapes the kickers, plants a forest and bakes the packed-snow
// field, and only then does the renderer get to build the terrain mesh off
// the heightfield, stand the trees up, lay the trail map and hand the whole
// scene to a driver that has to compile every shader in it.
//
// There are only two ways to pay for that, and one of them is not available.
// Bought in ONE synchronous call, the page simply stops — no frame, no cursor,
// nothing to say the press has landed; left to arrive during the race, the
// mesh building costs frames out of the ones the player is trying to ride in.
//
// So it is a LOAD, with a card over it (`loading-screen.tsx`). The work is the
// same work — the same functions in the same order — but it is cut into
// steps, and every step is asked to stop when the frame is spent so the card
// can be drawn. Nothing is deferred past the start line: by the time the card
// lifts the map is built, the scene is standing and the shaders are
// compiled. The race then costs what a race costs.
//
// This module is the SEQUENCING, and nothing else — it never learns what a
// step does, which is what keeps it DOM-free and testable
// (`tests/menu_system_test.ts`). The steps themselves are closures over the
// app's own refs (`app-load.ts`), and each brings the words the card says
// while it is being paid for.

 * transform (`mark-tracks.tsx`, and the phase bar in `loading-screen.tsx`),
 * which keeps moving through a main thread that is blocked solid. This is
 * what keeps the PAGE alive around it. A load that took every millisecond of
 * every frame would still animate,
 * and would still swallow a resize, a pointer event and the card's own
 * compositing along the way. Leaving four frames in ten costs a load a little
