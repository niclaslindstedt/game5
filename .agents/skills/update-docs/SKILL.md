# Updating the docs

**Governing spec sections:** §11.1 (`docs/` — real prose, no stubs, resolving cross-links), §21.5 (mandated because `docs/` is drift-prone).

The `docs/` pages describe the engine, the skier and snow model, the generator's rules, the sim harness, the app shell, the audio and the deploy plumbing. Each has concrete source files it must agree with; this skill re-syncs them.

## Tracking mechanism

`.agents/skills/update-docs/.last-updated` contains the git commit hash from the last successful run. Empty means "never run" — fall back to the initial commit.

## Discovery process

1. Read the baseline:

   ```sh
   BASELINE=$(cat .agents/skills/update-docs/.last-updated)
   ```

2. List changed files since then:

   ```sh
   git diff --name-only "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

3. Walk the mapping table; every hit schedules the named page for a re-read against its sources.

4. For scheduled pages, read the page AND its source files side by side; fix what disagrees (numbers, names, commands, claims, the model a formula is attributed to).

## Mapping table

| Changed source | Page(s) to re-sync |
| --- | --- |
| `engine/game/skier.ts`, `suspension.ts`, `snow.ts`, `poles.ts`, `flight.ts`, `chassis.ts`, `limits.ts`, `engine/game/defs/tuning.ts`, `defs/skis.ts` | `docs/riding.md` (the model, every quoted number, the measured table — re-run `npm run ride`) |
| `engine/game/collision.ts`, `course.ts` (trees, the edge, gates, the reset) | `docs/riding.md`, `docs/architecture.md` (the step, the events) |
| `engine/game/step.ts`, `run.ts`, `rivals.ts`, `state.ts`, `defs/modes.ts`, `place.ts`, `clock.ts` | `docs/architecture.md` |
| `engine/mapgen/rules.ts` (the R-rules are quoted verbatim — `tests/docs_rules_test.ts`) | `docs/level-generator.md` |
| `engine/mapgen/*` (the search, the mountain, the piste, the kickers, the start, the gates, the forest, the day, the `Level` shape) | `docs/level-generator.md` |
| `engine/analysis/*` (a check) | `docs/level-generator.md` |
| `engine/sim/*`, `scripts/simulate-run.mjs` (the bot, `RunReport`, the table) | `docs/simulation.md` (re-run `npm run sim` for the table) |
| `engine/index.ts`, module moves under `engine/` or `pwa/src/` | `docs/architecture.md` |
| `pwa/src/game/renderer.ts` and the modules it names, `camera*.ts`, `sky.ts`, `snow-glsl.ts`, `trail-*.ts` | `docs/architecture.md` (the app layer) |
| `pwa/src/App.tsx`, `shell.ts`, `menu-*.tsx`, `splash*.ts*`, `loading-screen.tsx`, `run-loader.ts`, `url-params.ts`, `settings*.ts` | `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/configuration.md` (the URL readers, what is stored) |
| `pwa/src/game/input.ts`, `input-model.ts`, `settings-input.ts`, `hud*.tsx` | `docs/getting-started.md` (the controls) |
| `pwa/src/game/audio/*`, `scripts/audition.mjs`, a framework tag moved | `docs/audio.md` |
| `scripts/*.mjs`, `Makefile` (a lab added or changed) | README Usage, `docs/troubleshooting.md` if it has a failure mode |
| `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, `release.yml`, `pwa/pwa-plugin.ts` | `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/platforms.md` |
| `pwa/src/identity.ts`, `pwa/public/*` | `docs/configuration.md` |
| `tauri/**`, `native/**` | `docs/platforms.md`, `docs/configuration.md` (the environment rows) |
| Error-shaped changes (new failure modes, new tooling) | `docs/troubleshooting.md` |
| `OSS_GAME_SPEC.md`, or a verdict under one of its chapters | `docs/spec-conformance.md` — the `sync-game-spec` skill re-dates it |

## Update checklist

- [ ] Read baseline and diff
- [ ] Re-sync every scheduled page against its sources
- [ ] Verify cross-links between docs pages and from the README still resolve
- [ ] `make fmt-check`
- [ ] Write the new baseline:

      git rev-parse HEAD > .agents/skills/update-docs/.last-updated

## Verification

1. Every quoted rule, number, command, filename and model citation in the touched pages exists in the source it cites.
2. No page contains "TODO" or stub text.
3. `.last-updated` points at the new HEAD.

## Skill self-improvement

After a run, grow the mapping table with any new source → page relationship you discovered, note recurring drift patterns (e.g. tuning constants quoted in `docs/riding.md`'s prose, the sim table in `docs/simulation.md` left at an old tuning), and commit the skill edit together with the docs edit.
