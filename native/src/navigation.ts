/**
 * Is this navigation leaving the SITE — somewhere the shell serves nothing?
 *
 * The WebView is the whole app: no address bar, no back button, and
 * `allowsBackForwardNavigationGestures` is off because a swipe belongs to the
 * handlebars. So a link to an off-site page (the HUD's build label links the
 * build's commit on GitHub) would replace the game with a web page the skier
 * cannot leave without killing the app. App.tsx hands such a URL to the
 * system browser instead.
 *
 * Only http(s) is judged, and everything else is INTERNAL by default: the
 * WebView's own `about:blank`, `blob:` and `data:` loads must not be cancelled,
 * and cancelling an unrecognised scheme would break a navigation this shell has
 * no opinion about. A null `origin` is the source not having resolved yet, so
 * there is nothing for a URL to be outside of.
 *
 * Compared by ORIGIN rather than by prefix, so a lookalike host cannot pass by
 * starting with ours (`http://localhost:9043.evil.test/`) and a deep link into
 * our own site cannot fail by differing in its path.
