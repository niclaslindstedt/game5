//! THE MENU BAR, AS DATA — every row the desktop app offers, what it is
//! called, what it is bound to, and who serves it. Nothing here draws a menu:
//! `src-tauri/src/menu.rs` turns this into a real one, and it is the only file
//! in the tree that knows what a `tauri::menu::Menu` is.
//!
//! **Why a game has a menu bar at all.** On macOS the menu bar is the
//! application, not the window: an app that declares no menu still gets one,
//! bare, carrying its name and a Quit. An empty bar reads as a web page in a
//! frame, which is the exact reading a store review is about — and it is the
//! first thing anyone sees.
//!
//! **THE ONE RULE THE ROWS OBEY: a menu row may only press a button the game
//! already has.** A shell is allowed to add a window, an offline copy and a
//! store listing, and nothing else — so no row here opens a surface the
//! website does not have, and the words it sends
//! ([`config::SHELL_COMMAND`](crate::config::SHELL_COMMAND)) are spelled again
//! in `pwa/src/shell-host.ts`, with `tests/tauri_test.ts` holding the two
//! lists together.
//!
//! **What is NOT here, and why:**
//!
//! - **A File menu.** There are no files: a run is not a document, nothing is
//!   opened and nothing is saved by name. The second menu is RACE, which is
//!   what its rows are actually about.
//! - **A bare-key accelerator.** Every binding below carries ⌘. The game reads
//!   the keyboard directly (Enter takes a picture, B restarts, R resets,
//!   Escape pauses, C walks the camera) and a menu accelerator wins before the
//!   page ever sees the key, so binding a naked Escape or C to a row would
//!   quietly take that key away from the skier.
//! - **Enable/disable state.** A row the game cannot serve where it stands
//!   does nothing rather than greying out, because greying out means the shell
//!   tracking what the page is showing — a whole second copy of the game's
//!   state, kept in a language that cannot see it.
