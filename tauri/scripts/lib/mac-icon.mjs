// THE MACOS ICON — the one platform whose icon is not simply the app mark in a
// square, and the file that says why.
//
// Every other launcher in this repo takes the mark full-bleed: Windows, Linux,
// Android and iOS all either fill the tile or apply their own mask over one.
// The Dock does not. A macOS app icon is a ROUNDED SQUARE FLOATING ON NOTHING,
// smaller than its own canvas, with a shadow under it — and an icon that
// ignores that is instantly legible as one, because it is visibly larger than
// every icon beside it and has hard corners where they have soft ones.
//
// So the mark is re-shaped here rather than re-drawn: masked to Apple's
// continuous-corner squircle, inset inside its canvas to leave the margin the
// shadow lives in, lit from above, and dropped onto a soft shadow.
//
// TWO MACOS ICON SYSTEMS EXIST AND THIS FILE SERVES THE OLDER ONE.
//
//   ≤ macOS 15 (Sequoia)  The app ships a finished picture and the system
//                         displays it. Everything below — the inset, the
//                         corner, the shadow, the lighting — is the app's job,
//                         and this is where it is done.
//   ≥ macOS 26 (Tahoe)    The system DRAWS the icon: a layered `.icon` is
//                         masked, lit, blurred and re-tinted by the compositor
//                         for the light, dark, clear and tinted appearances a
//                         player picks in the Dock. Layers, not a picture, and
//                         nothing in this tree writes them yet.
//
// The two do not fight: macOS 26 prefers a bundle's Assets.car when it has one
// and falls back to this `.icns` when it does not, while every older system
// reads only the `.icns`. Shipping just this one is not a bug on Tahoe — it is
// an icon that stays flat while its neighbours pick up the glass, which is
// what "looks dated" means in practice, and it is the store-listing work this
// repository has not started.
