// THE MOTOR — the one place in the app that actually makes a device buzz.
//
// `rumble.ts` decides WHAT is felt and how big it is, DOM-free and testable;
// this is the half that touches a device, and it is deliberately the whole
// of it: two roads out, one switch, and nothing else.
//
// The two roads, and why there are two. In a browser the pulse goes to the
// Vibration API, which is a duration and nothing more — an Android motor is
// on or off. In the store app it goes over the shell seam instead
// (`shell-host.ts` → `native/src/haptics.ts`): an iOS WebView has no
// Vibration API at all, and the phone underneath it has the best haptics the
// game will ever run on, so the page describes the pulse and lets the shell
// spend it. The website is still the product — every pulse in the game is
// authored, decided and switched off in here, and the shell only plays what
// it is handed.
