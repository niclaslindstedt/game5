// THE ATTRACT SCREEN — the policy behind `splash-screen.tsx`: when the title
// may appear, when a press may clear the card, and when the app is being
// driven by something that must not see a card at all.
//
// The card is not decoration. The app opens onto the main menu, and that menu
// is a LIVE RACE: the render stack has to come down the wire, the generator
// has to raise a whole mountainside and lay a loop over it, and the bots
// have to start racing it. All of that is spent BEHIND the card.
//
// It plays like an arcade cabinet, in two beats. First the house's name over
// an empty sky while the map is built. Then, the moment the game is standing,
// the app's own trails lay themselves, FALL LINE fades in under them, and
// the card asks for a press — and waits, however long that takes. Nothing
// lifts the card on a timer: the press is the point, and it buys two things
// a timer cannot. The player enters the menu when THEY are ready, and the gesture
// that enters is also the one a browser wants before it will let a game make
// a sound.
//
// Kept apart from the component so the timing rules are testable without a
// renderer (`tests/menu_system_test.ts`), which is also why this module takes the
// query string as an argument instead of reading `location` itself.

 * opened the PWA) arriving as the press that dismisses the card.

 * in a way the card cannot fix (a chunk that never landed, a context the GPU

 * in is worse than letting them through to a menu that may be half-built.

 * the map was still being built would hand the player exactly the empty blue
 * screen it was added to hide, so a slow device stays on the house's name
