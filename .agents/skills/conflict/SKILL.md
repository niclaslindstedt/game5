name: conflict
description: "Use whenever a branch has to move onto another one — a merge conflict has appeared, a PR is reported un-mergeable, or you are told to rebase, sync, update, or catch a branch up with main. Owns the seatbelt (the backup branch), the always-fetch rule, the commands that silently destroy a resolution, and how to resolve honestly rather than by picking a side."

# Merges, rebases, and the conflicts they raise

Load this **before** running a merge or a rebase, not after one has already gone
wrong. A conflicted working tree is the most fragile state a repo gets into, and
every rule below exists because the fragile state was entered without one.

**Read this skill's lessons first** —
`npx ogf-skill-lessons conflict --list`, then the ones this task
touches. Reflecting them back at the end is the **`skill-reflection`** skill's
job; load it at both ends of the session.

## The three steps, in the only order that works

| Step | What | Why it is not optional |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `git branch -f backup/<branch>-premerge HEAD` | The seatbelt. Free, and it saves everything |
| 2 | `git fetch origin main` | **The step that gets skipped** |
| 3 | `git rebase origin/main` | Onto the ref that was just fetched |

(Slashes in the branch name become dashes in the backup name:
`backup/claude-fix-air-gate-premerge`.)

---

## THE THREE RULES

### 1. Cut the backup branch FIRST

**Before starting a merge or a rebase that may conflict, park the branch:**

```sh
git branch -f backup/<branch-name>-premerge HEAD
```

The commands that feel like "let me just look at something else for a second" —
`git stash`, `git checkout <ref> -- .`, `git reset`, adding a worktree — will
happily throw the resolution away, clear `MERGE_HEAD`, and leave no obvious way
back. With the backup in place the recovery is one line:

```sh
git reset --hard backup/<branch-name>-premerge
```

instead of an archaeology session in the reflog. Without it, any unpushed work
in the merge is gone.

The name is `-premerge` for a rebase too. One name, whichever operation is
running — a name that changes with the mode is a name nobody remembers with a
conflicted tree in front of them.

**Delete the backup once the sync is committed, VERIFIED and PUSHED.** It is a
seatbelt, not a branch anybody should review. "Verified" means the checks
actually ran green on the merged tree — a merge that compiles is not a merge
that works, and the whole reason to merge before verifying is that the
verification is about the combination.

### 2. ALWAYS FETCH. There is no rebase that starts anywhere else

A rebase onto a `main` that was fetched an hour ago is a rebase onto a ref that
no longer exists anywhere but this clone. It conflicts against commits that are
already resolved upstream, every one of those conflicts has to be resolved by
hand, and then the next attempt raises them all over again because the
underlying ref is still stale. The work is not just wasted, it is repeated.

So: **`git fetch origin main` immediately before the rebase**, every time, even
when you fetched five minutes ago. It costs a second.

### 3. Never run an exploratory command against a conflicted tree

To see what another ref says, ask git directly — these read without touching a
file:

```sh
git show <ref>:<path>          # that ref's version of one file
git diff <ref>                 # what differs from it
git log --oneline HEAD..<ref>  # what landed that you do not have
```

If a build genuinely has to run on another ref, `git worktree add` a **separate
directory**, and do it **before** the merge starts, never during it.

And: **resolve, `git add`, and commit in one unbroken stretch.** Don't leave a
conflicted tree parked across unrelated work — not across a question to the
user, not across "let me just check CI". The state does not survive attention
going elsewhere.

---

## Rebase or merge?

| Situation | Do |
| --- | --- |
| Branch not pushed, or pushed and nobody else has it | **rebase** (the default) |
| Branch is on an open PR that a human is reviewing right now | **merge** |
| Branch has a merge commit in it you want to keep readable | merge |
| You were explicitly told to rebase | rebase |

A rebase rewrites history, so it needs `--force-with-lease` to push afterwards.
**Never plain `--force`** — with-lease refuses when the remote moved under you,
which is the case where forcing would delete somebody's work.

```sh
git push --force-with-lease
```

A merge does not rewrite anything and pushes normally. An open PR under review
is a branch other people may have checked out, and rewriting it under them is
rude in a way that is hard to undo.

---

## Resolving honestly

**A conflict is a question about intent, not a formatting problem.** The failure
mode to avoid is picking a side because one side is yours.

1. **Read both sides and work out what each was FOR.** `git log --oneline
HEAD..origin/main -- <path>` names the commit the other side came from; its
   message usually says why.
2. **The answer is often BOTH.** Two people adding a row to the same table, two
   people adding a changeset fragment, two people adding a scenario to
   `ride-scenarios.mjs` — the resolution keeps both, in a sensible order. Taking one
   is a silent revert of the other.
3. **When the two genuinely contradict**, `main` wins — it is already merged
   and already reviewed. Only diverge from that when both sides changed the
   same logic and picking either loses behavior; then ask.
4. **Never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` in a resolution.** The release workflow
   owns it; take `main`'s side and let the fragments in `.changes/unreleased/`
   carry this branch's entry.
5. **`package-lock.json`**: take either side, then `npm install` and commit
   what it writes.
6. **Version strings** (`engine/version.ts`, the `package.json`s) move only via
   the release workflow — resolve by taking `main`'s versions, never by
   splitting the difference.
7. **A tuning number both sides moved is TWO measurements, not a midpoint.**
   `defs/tuning.ts` and `defs/skis.ts` carry numbers each side tuned against
   its own `make sim` / `make ride` table; averaging them produces a value
   nobody measured. Take one side, then re-run the lab on the merged tree.
8. **Prove nothing was lost.** After resolving, diff the result against the
   other side and check that every hunk that disappeared was meant to:
   ```sh
   git diff origin/main -- <path>     # should be only YOUR changes
   ```

---

## The loop

```sh
git branch -f backup/<branch>-premerge HEAD  # 1. seatbelt
git fetch origin main                        # 2. fresh target
git rebase origin/main                       # 3. it stops on the first conflict
grep -rn '^<<<<<<<\|^>>>>>>>' .              # 4. find every marker
#    …resolve, applying the rules above…
git add <paths>                              # 5. stage — never `git add -A` here
git rebase --continue                        # 6. next commit, or done
grep -rn '^<<<<<<<\|^>>>>>>>' .              # 7. ZERO markers left. Check it.
make fmt && make lint                        # 8. the fast checks, on the merged tree
make test                                    # 9. …and the slow one
git push --force-with-lease                  # 10. (plain push after a merge)
git branch -D backup/<branch>-premerge       # 11. drop the seatbelt
```

Step 7 is not paranoia: a conflict marker inside a comment block or a markdown
code fence compiles, formats, and passes review. Grep for it.

Step 5 is `git add <paths>`, not `git add -A` — resolving is a judgement, and a
blanket stage would happily stage a file still holding markers.

A rebase replays **one commit at a time**, so steps 3–6 can repeat. That is
normal and it is not a sign anything is wrong.

## When it has already gone wrong

| Symptom | Do |
| --- | --- |
| Resolution looks wrong, mid-conflict | `git rebase --abort` (or `git merge --abort`) |
| Abort did not restore what you expected | `git reset --hard backup/<branch>-premerge` |
| No backup was cut and work is missing | `git reflog` — the commits are there for ~90 days |
| Rebase finished but the result is wrong | `git reset --hard backup/<branch>-premerge`, start again |
| Pushed a bad rebase | reset to the backup, `git push --force-with-lease` again |
| PR says "un-mergeable" but merging says up-to-date | GitHub's mergeability is computed lazily — re-check after a push |

---

## Verification

The sync is done when **all** of these hold:

- `grep -rn '^<<<<<<<\|^=======\|^>>>>>>>'` finds nothing outside this file.
- `git diff <base> -- <each conflicted path>` shows only the changes this branch
  was supposed to make.
- `make fmt-check`, `make lint` and `make test` are green **on the merged tree**
  — not on the pre-merge one. This is the whole point of the exercise.
- If skis, snow or generator code was involved on either side, `make sim`
  still shows bots finishing.
- The branch is pushed, and only then is the backup deleted.

## Skill self-improvement

When a session learns something here — a resolution pattern, a git command that
behaved unexpectedly, a file that must never be hand-merged — record it as a
lesson fragment under `.agents/skills/conflict/.lessons/` in the format
[`skill-reflection`](../skill-reflection/SKILL.md) owns, and let that skill
decide at the end of the session whether it belongs in this file instead.
Never append lessons to this `SKILL.md` directly.
