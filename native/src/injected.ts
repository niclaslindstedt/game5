// JavaScript injected into the game WebView. Five jobs, all invisible to the
// game's own code — the first four run on their own as the page loads, the
// fifth is fired at it by the shell when the phone does something the page
// cannot see:
//
//  1. NATIVE_FLAG — names this shell to the page BEFORE the game boots, on
//     the one global every shell shares (`__SH_SHELL__`, read by
//     pwa/src/shell-host.ts; the desktop app writes "tauri" there the same
//     way). The web app reads it on its very first render to turn the PWA
//     update lifecycle off: the shell bundles the game and ships updates
//     through the store, so there is no service worker to install and no "a
//     new version is ready" card to show — a player updates by downloading a
//     new build, never by an in-page reload. Frozen, so nothing on the page
//     can later claim to be a browser.
//
//  2. RUMBLE_BRIDGE — carry the page's vibration asks out to the phone's own
//     haptics. The website decides what is felt and how big it is
//     (pwa/src/game/rumble.ts) and dispatches a DOM event describing each
//     pulse; a browser with a motor answers it itself, and a WKWebView —
//     which has no Vibration API at all — has this listener instead, relaying
//     the pulse over the message channel to src/haptics.ts. Injected BEFORE
//     the content for the same reason the flag is: a listener added after the
//     game's first frame is a landing nobody feels.
//
//  3. CLOUD_BRIDGE — carry the page's cloud asks out to iCloud. The website
//     owns what is saved and how two devices reconcile
//     (pwa/src/game/cloud-save.ts); the shell moves an opaque string and says
//     what happened (src/cloud-save.ts). Injected before the content so an
//     ask made during the game's first frame is heard.
//
//  4. VIEWPORT_HARDENING — make the page feel like an app, not a document:
//     kill the long-press callout/selection and rubber-band scroll that a raw
//     WKWebView still allows even with the website's own viewport meta.
//
//  5. SHOT_COMMAND — press the game's own SHUTTER, because the phone has one
//     of its own and the page cannot hear it. Fired through
//     `injectJavaScript` when the OS says the skier took a screenshot
//     (src/screen-capture.ts), so the picture they took with the hardware is
//     also filed in the game's gallery.
//
// Every script must be an IIFE ending in `true;` — iOS requires an injected
// script to evaluate to a primitive, or it warns and aborts.
