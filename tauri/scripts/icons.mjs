// The app icon, in the one format Tauri insists on.
//
// **Tauri refuses anything but an RGBA PNG at COMPILE time**, inside
// `generate_context!`, with `icon … is not RGBA` — and the website's icons are
// RGB, because `scripts/lib/png.mjs` (the repo's own encoder) writes RGB and a
// launcher icon has no use for an alpha channel. So the icons are RE-ENCODED
// rather than re-drawn: one source raster, the same one the manifest already
// installs, decoded, resized and widened to 8-bit RGBA at the sizes Tauri's
// bundler wants. Nothing here is a design decision — the art is
// `pwa/public/icons/`, made by `make icons`, and a change to the mark happens
// there and lands here on the next build (OSS_GAME_SPEC §11.2: this output is
// generated and gitignored).
//
// Pure Node, like the encoder it mirrors: a PNG decoder for the one shape of
// file the icon generator writes (8-bit, non-interlaced, RGB or RGBA) is fifty
// lines over `zlib`, and it keeps this tree free of a native image dependency
// — which matters on the packaging runners, where an image library would be a
// second platform-specific download.
//
// THE MACOS SET IS THE ONE EXCEPTION to "nothing here is a design decision".
// A Dock icon is not the mark in a square — it is a rounded square floating on
// its own shadow, inset inside its canvas — so the macOS ladder is RE-SHAPED
// as well as re-encoded, by `lib/mac-icon.mjs`, which carries the geometry and
// the reasoning. The mark itself is still untouched.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/icons.mjs            # write tauri/src-tauri/icons/
//   node scripts/icons.mjs --check    # fail if they are missing or stale
