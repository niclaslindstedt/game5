# Maintenance

This is the umbrella skill for Fall Line, mandated by §21.6 of `OSS_GAME_SPEC.md`. It does no rewriting itself — it decides which sync skills are stale, runs each one, and reports a combined summary. Use it when you do not know which specific artifact is out of date, or when several have likely drifted at once (for example, after a large merge).

## When to run

- After a big merge from the default branch when you are not sure which surfaces moved.
- On a cadence (weekly / before a release) as a "drift sweep".
- When a review flags stale docs but it is unclear which skill to invoke.

Do **not** use this skill for a targeted fix — if you know exactly which artifact is stale, call the corresponding `update-*` skill directly.

## Registry

The registry is the single source of truth for which sync skills exist in this repo. Every `update-*` directory under `.agents/skills/` must appear here exactly once. Add rows whenever you create a new sync skill.

| Skill | Fixes | Spec sections | Run order |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `update-docs` | `docs/*.md` vs. engine/app/tooling source of truth | §11.1 | 1 |
| `update-readme` | `README.md` vs. current commands, the skis, controls, URLs | §3 | 2 |
| `update-website` | SEO surfaces + identity-derived shell vs. `identity.ts`/docs | §11.2–§11.3 | 3 |

Run order matters: `update-docs` runs before `update-readme` because the README links into docs pages and summarizes their content — a README synced against stale docs re-imports the staleness. `update-website` runs after both because the identity-derived shell is checked against what the README and docs claim. There is no `prompts/` tree in this repo, so there is no `update-prompts` skill; the day an LLM prompt ships, port the sibling repos' and add its row here, last.

After the registry, finish a full sweep with the `sync-game-spec` skill — it walks `OSS_GAME_SPEC.md` chapter by chapter, catches the residual conformance violations the per-artifact skills did not touch, and re-dates every row of `docs/spec-conformance.md`.

## Discovery process

For each skill in the registry, decide whether it needs to run:

1. Read the skill's baseline:

   ```sh
   BASELINE=$(cat .agents/skills/<skill>/.last-updated)
   ```

   An empty or missing file means "never run" — schedule it. Every baseline in this repository starts empty (the bootstrap shipped them that way, per §21.4), so the first sweep runs every skill against the initial commit.

2. Diff the watched paths for that skill against the baseline:

   ```sh
   git diff --name-only "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

   If any file in the skill's mapping table appears in the diff, schedule the skill.

3. Build the list of skills to run, preserving the run order from the registry.

## Execution

For each scheduled skill, in order:

1. Load `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`.
2. Follow its discovery process, mapping table, and update checklist exactly.
3. Verify the skill's own verification section passes.
4. Record the commit hash the skill wrote to its `.last-updated`.

Between skills, do **not** commit — aggregate all edits into a single working tree so the final commit covers the whole sync sweep.

## Tracking mechanism

This skill's own `.agents/skills/maintenance/.last-updated` records the commit of the last full sweep. Individual skills keep their own baselines; this one only marks "a sweep happened".

## Update checklist

- [ ] Read every skill's `.last-updated` and build the schedule
- [ ] Run each scheduled skill per its SKILL.md
- [ ] Run `make test` and `make lint` over the combined result
- [ ] Write `git rev-parse HEAD` into this skill's `.last-updated`
- [ ] Summarize per-skill outcomes in the commit/PR body

## Verification

1. Every scheduled skill's verification section passed.
2. `make test`, `make lint`, and `make fmt-check` are green on the combined tree.
3. All `.last-updated` files (this one included) point at the new HEAD.

## Skill self-improvement

After a sweep, improve this file in place: add newly created `update-*` skills to the registry (with a run-order rationale), record recurring cross-skill orderings you discovered, and commit the skill edit together with the sweep so the knowledge compounds.
